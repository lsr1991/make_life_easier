### Project Description

This is my awesome project.

It is used for making the management of a project easier by defining a directory organizing template.

### Project Structure

It is organized into the following structure:

* Doc:     Contains all up-to-date documents.
* Code:    Contains all up-to-date code.
* Demo:    Contains all up-to-date demo presentations and videos.
* Task:    Contains all data of in-progress tasks.
            When a task is finished, it should contribute to Code, Doc, or
            Demo, and its folder should be moved to Archive.
* _Archive: Contains all out-of-date files. 
            When any file is out of date, it will be moved to here and be kept
            the same path where it locates. e.g. 03_Archive/00_Doc/old_doc.
